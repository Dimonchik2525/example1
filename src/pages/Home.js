                     This app was creacted by me for leading statistics about alina's clients <br />
                     it took about 2-3 weeks, login isnt working, just tap on log in and you'll access. you can click on clients everywhere and get full information about current client. Also you can sort leaderbord or other information you want. <br /> Enjoy this site:)
